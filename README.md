# Choices

Why I made a few choices.

- Not adding bootstrap. The test did not require bootstrap as it involved only basic changes. Which can be handled by css itself. Only few utility classes were of use like d-flex, d-block, magin and padding classes. Which I handled by myself.

- I have not added much tests. Because the application right now has no complex transformations. It is mostly made of presentational components.

- Error handling could be done more generic but this application had only one api call so did not make error handling more generic.

- semantic html- Not enough info that if it is user facing app that needs seo if it needs seo than only symantic versioning will help.
